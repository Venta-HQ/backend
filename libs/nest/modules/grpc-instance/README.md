# gRPC Instance Module

## Purpose

The gRPC Instance module provides reusable gRPC client management for the Venta backend system. It includes client connection pooling, retry logic, and metadata propagation for efficient inter-service communication.

## What It Contains

- **gRPC Instance Service**: Main gRPC client service with connection management
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient gRPC client connection reuse
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry mechanisms for failed requests
- **Metadata Propagation**: Request context and metadata handling

## Usage

This module is imported by services that need to communicate with other microservices via gRPC.

### For Services
- Import gRPC instance service for client connections
- Use connection pooling for optimal performance
- Apply retry logic for reliability
- Configure metadata propagation for request tracking

### For Inter-Service Communication
- Import gRPC clients for service-to-service calls
- Use connection management for efficient communication
- Apply retry mechanisms for fault tolerance
- Configure client settings for different services

## Key Benefits

- **Performance**: Efficient connection pooling and reuse
- **Reliability**: Automatic retry mechanisms and error handling
- **Maintainability**: Centralized gRPC client management
- **Observability**: Request tracking and metadata propagation

## Dependencies

- gRPC for service communication
- NestJS framework
- TypeScript for type definitions
