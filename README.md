## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Venta Backend is a distributed system built with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, consisting of multiple microservices organized around business domains. The system follows modern architectural patterns including gRPC for inter-service communication, WebSocket for real-time features, and a unified API gateway.

**✅ Phase 2 Complete** - Domain Services enhanced with unified error handling, centralized event management, and DDD-aligned structure. See [DDD Migration Status](./docs/ddd-migration-status.md) for current progress.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

### 🚀 Core Services

| Service               | Purpose                        | Protocol  | Domain           | Description                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |

### 📚 Shared Libraries

| Library              | Purpose           | Description                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **API Types**        | Type Definitions  | DDD-aligned schemas and validation    |
| **Event Types**      | Event Management  | Centralized event definitions and schemas |
| **NestJS Shared**    | Framework Modules | Unified error handling and utilities  |
| **Protocol Buffers** | gRPC Definitions  | Service contracts and generated code  |
| **Utilities**        | Helper Functions  | Common utility functions and helpers  |

### 🎯 DDD Domains

The system is organized into four main business domains:

- **Marketplace**: User management, vendor management, subscriptions, and search
- **Location Services**: Real-time location tracking and geospatial operations
- **Communication**: Webhooks and external integrations
- **Infrastructure**: API gateway, file management, and system operations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 📋 Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **pnpm** package manager
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **PostgreSQL** database
- **Redis** cache

### ⚡ Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Generate Prisma client
pnpm run prisma:generate

# Build protocol buffers
pnpm run build-proto

# Build the project
pnpm run build
```

### 🛠️ Development

```bash
# Start all services with Docker Compose
pnpm run docker:up

# Run tests
pnpm run test:run

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm run test:coverage

# Lint code
pnpm run lint

# Format code
pnpm run format
```

### 🔧 Running Individual Services

```bash
# Start specific service
pnpm run start:dev api-gateway
pnpm run start:dev user-management
pnpm run start:dev vendor-management
pnpm run start:dev location-services
pnpm run start:dev real-time-gateway
pnpm run start:dev search-discovery
```

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/venta"

# Redis
REDIS_PASSWORD="your-redis-password"

# Services
GATEWAY_SERVICE_PORT=5002
USER_SERVICE_ADDRESS=localhost:5000
USER_HEALTH_PORT=5010
VENDOR_SERVICE_ADDRESS=localhost:5005
VENDOR_HEALTH_PORT=5015
LOCATION_SERVICE_ADDRESS=localhost:5001
LOCATION_HEALTH_PORT=5011
WEBSOCKET_GATEWAY_SERVICE_PORT=5004
ALGOLIA_SYNC_HEALTH_PORT=5016

# External Services
CLERK_SECRET_KEY="your-clerk-secret"
ALGOLIA_APP_ID="your-algolia-app-id"
ALGOLIA_API_KEY="your-algolia-api-key"
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your-cloudinary-name"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your-cloudinary-key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your-cloudinary-secret"

# DDD Domain (automatically set by bootstrap)
DOMAIN=marketplace
```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

1. **Feature Development**: Create feature branches from `main`
2. **Testing**: Write tests for new functionality
3. **Code Quality**: Ensure code passes linting and formatting
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant README files
5. **Review**: Submit pull requests for code review

## 🧪 Testing

The project uses Vitest for testing with comprehensive coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm run test:run

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm run test

# Run tests with UI
pnpm run test:ui

# Generate coverage report
pnpm run test:coverage
```

## 🚀 Deployment

The system is containerized using Docker and can be deployed using Docker Compose or Kubernetes.

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build all services
docker-compose build

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```
