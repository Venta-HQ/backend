# Controller & Service Comparison: event-pattern-initial vs main

## Overview
This document provides a detailed comparison of every controller and service between the event-pattern-initial branch and the main branch to ensure functional parity.

## Missing Files in Main Branch
- ❌ `apps/vendor/src/health/health.controller.ts` - Missing health controller in vendor app

## File-by-File Comparison

### 1. Gateway Controllers

- ✅ Removed UpdateVendorSchema import

#### `apps/gateway/src/user/user.controller.ts`
**Status**: ❌ Has Differences
**Notes**: 
- Main branch has Logger injection that event-pattern-initial doesn't have
- Main branch has different import paths for AuthGuard and GrpcInstance
- Main branch has different import path for GrpcInstance

#### `apps/gateway/src/upload/upload.controller.ts`
**Status**: ✅ Fixed - Now Identical
**Notes**: 
- ✅ Removed Logger injection

#### `apps/user/src/clerk/clerk.service.ts`
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs Comparison
**Notes**: Need to compare implementations

#### `apps/user/src/subscription/subscription.controller.ts`
**Status**: ❌ Has Differences
**Notes**: 
- Main branch has EventsService injection and event publishing
- Main branch has different data handling: `data.data` vs `data.data ? JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(data.data)) : undefined`
- Main branch has event publishing in handleSubscriptionCreated method

#### `apps/user/src/subscription/subscription.service.ts`
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs Comparison
**Notes**: Need to compare implementations

#### `apps/user/src/vendor/vendor.controller.ts`
**Status**: ❌ Has Differences
**Notes**: 
- Main branch has Logger injection that event-pattern-initial doesn't have
