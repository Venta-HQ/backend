# Library Comparison: event-pattern-initial vs main

## Overview
This document provides a detailed comparison of every library between the event-pattern-initial branch and the main branch to ensure functional parity.

## Library Structure Comparison

### **Structural Differences**
- **Main Branch**: Consolidated structure with `libs/nest/` containing most modules
- **Event-Pattern-Initial**: Separate libraries for each module (auth, config, database, errors, events, etc.)

### 1. API Types Library (`libs/apitypes/`)

#### `libs/apitypes/src/index.ts`
**Status**: ❌ Has Differences
**Notes**: 
- Main branch missing exports for helpers, vendor types, and subscription types
- Main branch only exports location types and schemas

#### `libs/apitypes/src/lib/helpers.ts`
**Status**: ✅ Identical
**Notes**: 
- ✅ Both branches have identical AuthedRequest type definition

#### `libs/apitypes/src/lib/location/`
**Status**: ✅ Identical
**Notes**: 
- ✅ Location types are identical
- ✅ Location schemas are identical

#### `libs/apitypes/src/lib/subscription/`
**Status**: ✅ Identical
**Notes**: 
- ✅ Subscription types are identical

#### `libs/apitypes/src/lib/user/`
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs Comparison
**Notes**: Need to compare user schemas and types

#### `libs/apitypes/src/lib/vendor/`
**Status**: ❌ Has Differences
**Notes**: 
- Main branch missing VendorEvent, VendorCreatedEvent, VendorUpdatedEvent, and VendorDeletedEvent interfaces
- Main branch only has CreateVendorData and UpdateVendorData types

### 2. Nest Library (`libs/nest/`) - Main Branch Only

#### `libs/nest/errors/`
**Status**: ✅ Identical
**Notes**: 
- ✅ Error codes are identical
- ✅ AppError class is identical
- ✅ Exception filter is identical

#### `libs/nest/filters/`
**Status**: ❌ Has Differences
**Notes**: 
- Main branch has separate filters for each protocol (HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket)
- Event-pattern-initial has unified AppExceptionFilter
- Main branch filters are simpler and less comprehensive
- Need to decide which approach to use

#### `libs/nest/guards/`
**Status**: ❌ Has Differences
**Notes**: 
- Main branch uses HttpError instead of AppError
- Main branch has different caching logic (sets cache before assigning internalUserId)
- Event-pattern-initial has more comprehensive auth library with additional services

#### `libs/nest/modules/`
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs Comparison
**Notes**: Need to compare all NestJS modules

#### `libs/nest/pipes/`
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs Comparison
**Notes**: Need to compare validation pipes

### 3. Proto Library (`libs/proto/`)

#### `libs/proto/src/definitions/`
**Status**: ✅ Identical
**Notes**: 
- ✅ All protobuf definitions are identical

#### `libs/proto/src/lib/`
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs Comparison
**Notes**: Need to compare generated protobuf types

### 4. Utils Library (`libs/utils/`)

#### `libs/utils/src/lib/retry.util.ts`
**Status**: ✅ Identical
**Notes**: 
- ✅ Retry utility implementation is identical

### 5. Event-Pattern-Initial Specific Libraries

#### `libs/auth/` - Event-Pattern-Initial Only
**Status**: ❌ Has Differences
**Notes**: 
- Main branch has Logger injection in ClerkService
- Main branch uses AppError instead of generic Error in ClerkService
- Event-pattern-initial has more comprehensive auth library with additional services

#### `libs/config/` - Event-Pattern-Initial Only
**Status**: ✅ Identical
**Notes**: 
- ✅ Config schema is identical

#### `libs/database/` - Event-Pattern-Initial Only
**Status**: ✅ Identical
**Notes**: 
- ✅ Prisma service is identical

#### `libs/errors/` - Event-Pattern-Initial Only
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs Comparison
**Notes**: Need to compare with main branch errors implementation

#### `libs/events/` - Event-Pattern-Initial Only
**Status**: ✅ Identical
**Notes**: 
- ✅ Events interface is identical
- ✅ NATS events service is identical

#### `libs/grpc/` - Event-Pattern-Initial Only
**Status**: ✅ Identical
**Notes**: 
- ✅ gRPC instance service is identical

#### `libs/health/` - Event-Pattern-Initial Only
**Status**: ✅ Identical
**Notes**: 
- ✅ Health controller is identical

#### `libs/logger/` - Event-Pattern-Initial Only
**Status**: ✅ Identical
**Notes**: 
- ✅ Logger service is identical

#### `libs/redis/` - Event-Pattern-Initial Only
**Status**: ✅ Identical
**Notes**: 
- ✅ Redis module is identical

#### `libs/search/` - Event-Pattern-Initial Only
**Status**: ❌ Has Differences
**Notes**: 
- Main branch has different return type handling in updateObject method
- Main branch returns undefined instead of null when no hits found

#### `libs/upload/` - Event-Pattern-Initial Only
**Status**: ❌ Has Differences
**Notes**: 
- Main branch has Logger injection
- Main branch uses Express.Multer.File type instead of any
- Main branch has different error handling in uploadImage method

#### `libs/validation/` - Event-Pattern-Initial Only
**Status**: ✅ Identical
**Notes**: 
- ✅ Schema validator pipe is identical
