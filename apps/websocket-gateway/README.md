# WebSocket Gateway Service

## Purpose

The WebSocket Gateway service provides real-time communication capabilities for the Venta backend system. It handles WebSocket connections, manages real-time data streaming, and enables bidirectional communication between clients and the backend services.

## Overview

This service provides:
- Real-time WebSocket connections for clients
- Live location updates and tracking
- Real-time notifications and alerts
- Bidirectional communication channels
- Connection management and scaling
- Real-time data synchronization

## Key Responsibilities

- **Connection Management**: Handles WebSocket connection establishment and maintenance
- **Real-time Updates**: Streams live data updates to connected clients
- **Location Streaming**: Provides real-time location updates for tracking
- **Event Broadcasting**: Broadcasts events to multiple connected clients
- **Connection Scaling**: Manages multiple concurrent WebSocket connections
- **Authentication**: Validates WebSocket connections and user sessions
- **Error Handling**: Manages connection errors and recovery

## Architecture

The service follows an event-driven architecture pattern, where it listens for events from other services and broadcasts them to connected WebSocket clients. It maintains connection state and handles the real-time communication layer of the system.

## Dependencies

- Location service for real-time location data
- User service for authentication and user management
- Event system for receiving real-time events
- Redis for connection state management
