# Vendor Service

## Purpose

The Vendor service manages all vendor-related operations in the Venta backend system. It handles vendor creation, updates, profile management, and vendor data operations. This service serves as the central authority for vendor information and business logic.

## Overview

This microservice provides:
- Vendor account creation and management
- Vendor profile and business information management
- Vendor data validation and sanitization
- Vendor search and discovery functionality
- Vendor relationship management with users
- Vendor business logic and rules enforcement

## Key Responsibilities

- **Vendor Management**: Handles vendor registration, updates, and deletion
- **Profile Management**: Manages vendor profiles, business details, and settings
- **Data Validation**: Ensures vendor data integrity and compliance
- **Search Operations**: Provides vendor search and filtering capabilities
- **Business Logic**: Enforces vendor-related business rules and policies
- **Event Publishing**: Publishes vendor-related events for other services
- **Relationship Management**: Manages connections between vendors and users

## Architecture

The service follows a domain-driven design approach, focusing specifically on vendor-related business logic. It exposes gRPC endpoints for other services to consume and publishes events for asynchronous communication with the rest of the system.

## Dependencies

- Database for vendor data persistence
- Event system for publishing vendor events
- User service for user-vendor relationships
