# Location Service

## Purpose

The Location service manages all location-related operations in the Venta backend system. It handles real-time location tracking, geospatial queries, location updates, and location-based services. This service serves as the central authority for location data and geospatial operations.

## Overview

This microservice provides:
- Real-time location tracking and updates
- Geospatial queries and proximity searches
- Location data validation and processing
- Location-based service recommendations
- Location history and analytics
- Geofencing and location-based notifications

## Key Responsibilities

- **Location Tracking**: Handles real-time location updates from mobile devices
- **Geospatial Queries**: Provides location-based search and filtering
- **Proximity Services**: Calculates distances and finds nearby entities
- **Location Validation**: Ensures location data accuracy and integrity
- **Geofencing**: Manages location-based boundaries and triggers
- **Event Publishing**: Publishes location-related events for other services
- **Analytics**: Provides location-based insights and reporting

## Architecture

The service follows a domain-driven design approach, focusing specifically on location-related business logic. It exposes gRPC endpoints for other services to consume and publishes events for asynchronous communication with the rest of the system.

## Dependencies

- Database for location data persistence
- Redis for real-time location caching
- Event system for publishing location events
- Vendor service for vendor location data
