# Algolia Sync Service

## Purpose

The Algolia Sync service maintains synchronization between the Venta backend system and Algolia search indices. It listens for data changes in the system and automatically updates the search indices to ensure search results remain current and accurate.

## Overview

This service provides:
- Real-time synchronization with Algolia search indices
- Automatic index updates based on system events
- Search data optimization and indexing
- Search result consistency and accuracy
- Background indexing and data processing
- Search performance optimization

## Key Responsibilities

- **Event Listening**: Monitors system events for data changes
- **Index Synchronization**: Updates Algolia indices when data changes
- **Data Transformation**: Converts system data to search-optimized format
- **Error Handling**: Manages synchronization failures and retries
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensures efficient indexing and search performance
- **Data Consistency**: Maintains consistency between system data and search indices
- **Background Processing**: Handles indexing tasks without blocking other operations

## Architecture

The service follows an event-driven architecture pattern, where it subscribes to events from other services and processes them to update search indices. It operates as a background service that ensures search data remains synchronized with the main system.

## Dependencies

- Algolia search service
- Event system for receiving data change events
- Vendor service for vendor data updates
- Database for data validation and consistency checks
