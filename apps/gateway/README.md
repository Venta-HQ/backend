# Gateway Service

## Purpose

The Gateway service acts as the main entry point for all external HTTP requests to the Venta backend system. It provides a unified API interface, handles authentication, routes requests to appropriate microservices, and manages cross-cutting concerns like CORS, rate limiting, and request validation.

## Overview

This service serves as the API gateway that:
- Exposes RESTful endpoints for client applications
- Authenticates and authorizes incoming requests
- Routes requests to the appropriate microservices via gRPC
- Handles file uploads and media processing
- Manages webhook endpoints for external integrations
- Provides unified error handling and response formatting

## Key Responsibilities

- **Request Routing**: Directs incoming HTTP requests to the correct microservices
- **Authentication**: Validates user tokens and manages session state
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse through request throttling
- **CORS Management**: Handles cross-origin requests from web clients
- **Request Validation**: Validates incoming request data using schemas
- **Response Transformation**: Formats responses consistently across all endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Provides unified error responses and logging

## Architecture

The gateway follows a stateless design pattern where each request is processed independently. It communicates with microservices using gRPC for efficient inter-service communication and maintains no persistent state between requests.

## Dependencies

- User service for authentication and user management
- Vendor service for vendor-related operations
- Upload service for file processing
- External webhook services for integrations
