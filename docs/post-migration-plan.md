# Post-Migration Plan

## Phase 1: Cleanup & Organization ðŸ§¹

### 1. Code Organization

#### Move Domain-Specific Code to Domains

- [ ] Audit `libs/` for domain-specific code
  - [ ] Move domain-specific types from `apitypes` to respective domains
  - [ ] Move domain-specific events from `eventtypes` to respective domains
  - [ ] Move domain-specific utilities to respective domains
  - [ ] Keep only truly shared types/events in libs

#### Consolidate Shared Code in Libs

- [ ] Identify common patterns across domains
- [ ] Create reusable utilities in `libs/utils`
  - [ ] Error handling utilities
  - [ ] Validation helpers
  - [ ] Type guards
  - [ ] Date/time utilities
- [ ] Move shared infrastructure code to `libs/nest`
  - [ ] Common interceptors
  - [ ] Common filters
  - [ ] Common guards
  - [ ] Common decorators

#### Clean Up Domain Structure

- [ ] Standardize folder structure across domains
  ```
  domain/
  â”œâ”€â”€ contracts/          # Domain contracts
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ acl/           # Anti-corruption layers
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mappers/       # Context mappers
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types/         # Contract types
  â”œâ”€â”€ events/            # Domain events
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ schemas/       # Event schemas
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types/         # Event types
  â””â”€â”€ services/          # Domain services
      â”œâ”€â”€ shared/        # Shared domain code
      â””â”€â”€ [service]/     # Individual services

### 3. Module Analysis & Optimization

#### Audit Existing Modules

1. **Core Infrastructure Modules**

  - [ ] Find improvement opportunities

3. **Common Patterns**

- [ ] Analyze service bootstrapping
- [ ] Review middleware usage
- [ ] Check interceptor patterns
- [ ] Examine guard implementations

#### Module Improvement Strategy

After analysis, for each module we'll:

1. **Document Current State**

   - [ ] List all exports and features
   - [ ] Map integration points
   - [ ] Document configuration options
   - [ ] Identify dependencies

2. **Evaluate Usage**

   - [ ] Find all usage locations
   - [ ] Note common patterns
   - [ ] Identify misuse/antipatterns
   - [ ] Check test coverage

3. **Assess Pain Points**

   - [ ] Configuration complexity
   - [ ] Missing features
   - [ ] Common workarounds
   - [ ] Integration issues

4. **Plan Improvements**

   - [ ] Simplification opportunities
   - [ ] Feature gaps to fill
   - [ ] Breaking changes needed
   - [ ] Migration strategy

5. **Review Module Organization**

   - [ ] Check module boundaries
   - [ ] Verify dependency graph
   - [ ] Look for circular dependencies
   - [ ] Assess module cohesion

6. **Analyze Bootstrap Usage**
   - [ ] Review service initialization
   - [ ] Check middleware setup
   - [ ] Examine error handling
   - [ ] Verify configuration flow

#### Module Best Practices

- [ ] **Configuration**

  - Use dynamic modules for configuration
  - Support environment overrides
  - Include validation
  - Provide sensible defaults

- [ ] **Composability**

  - Make modules independent
  - Allow feature toggles
  - Support partial imports
  - Enable easy extension

- [ ] **Testing**
  - Create test helpers
  - Mock providers
  - Support unit testing
  - Enable integration testing

### 4. Library Organization

#### Shared Libraries (`libs/`)

- [ ] `nest/` - NestJS utilities
  - [ ] Keep only framework-specific code
  - [ ] Move domain-specific middleware out
  - [ ] Organize by functionality (auth, logging, etc.)

  - [ ] Add proper documentation
  - [ ] Add comprehensive tests
  - [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] `proto/` - Protocol buffers
