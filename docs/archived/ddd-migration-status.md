# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Migration Status

This document tracks the progress of our DDD migration across all phases.

## Migration Overview

We are transitioning from a technical-focused architecture to a domain-driven design that aligns with business capabilities and improves team scalability.

## Phase Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Domain Separation - COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date**: Completed in previous iterations  
**Scope**: Initial domain separation and service boundaries

**Completed Tasks**:

- ✅ Separated services by business domains (marketplace, location-services, communication, infrastructure)
- ✅ Established clear domain boundaries
- ✅ Created domain-specific modules and services
- ✅ Implemented basic domain separation patterns

### ✅ Phase 2: Event Schema Standardization - COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date**: Completed in previous iterations  
**Scope**: Standardized event schemas and validation

**Completed Tasks**:

- ✅ Implemented Zod-based event schemas
- ✅ Created centralized `eventtypes` library
- ✅ Standardized event validation patterns
- ✅ Established type-safe event emission
- ✅ Implemented unified event registry

### ✅ Phase 3: Domain Events with Rich Context - COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date**: December 2024  
**Scope**: Transition to domain events with automatic business context

**Completed Tasks**:

- ✅ **DDD Event Naming**: Migrated all events to domain-based naming (`marketplace.vendor.onboarded`, `location.vendor.location_updated`)
- ✅ **Automatic Context Extraction**: Enhanced `EventService` to automatically extract business identifiers from Zod schemas
- ✅ **Type-Based Validation**: Implemented compile-time validation for event patterns using TypeScript template literal types
- ✅ **Schema-Driven Business Context**: Events now automatically include relevant business identifiers (vendorId, userId, etc.)
- ✅ **Simplified API**: Maintained existing `eventService.emit()` pattern while adding automatic context
- ✅ **Event Structure Refactoring**: Updated `BaseEvent` to use `context`, `meta`, and `data` structure
- ✅ **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Removed theoretical/unused domains and schemas
- ✅ **Logging Standardization**: Fixed and standardized all logging patterns across the codebase

**Key Improvements**:

- **Event Naming**: `vendor.onboarded` → `marketplace.vendor.onboarded`
- **Automatic Context**: No more manual business context extraction
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time validation of event patterns
- **Cleaner Schemas**: Removed unused fields, added missing ones
- **Structured Logging**: All logs now include proper structured data and stack traces

### ✅ Phase 4: Bounded Contexts - IN PROGRESS

**Status**: ✅ Week 3 Complete — ACLs and Context Mappers Integrated  
**Date**: December 2024  
**Scope**: Implement bounded context boundaries with context mappings and domain contracts

**Migration Strategy**: **Unified Patterns**

- **Domain Contracts** for all inter-domain communication
- **Context Mappings** for all data translation between domains
- **No mixing** of direct gRPC calls with domain contracts

**Completed Tasks**:

- ✅ **Define Bounded Contexts**: Established clear boundaries for each domain
- ✅ **Context Mapping Strategy**: Defined mapping between different bounded contexts
- ✅ **Domain Interface Contracts**: Defined explicit contracts between bounded contexts
- ✅ **Bounded Context Communication Guide**: Created comprehensive guide explaining why domain contracts are necessary
- ✅ **Context Mapping Reorganization**: Reorganized files to follow domain-specific patterns
- ✅ **DDD Context Mapping Refactoring**: Directional, outbound mappers per-domain; removed cross-domain imports
- ✅ **Anti-Corruption Layers**: Implemented ACLs for Clerk and RevenueCat
- ✅ **Context Validation**: Validation and error handling patterns in mappers/ACLs
- ✅ **Simplification & Cleanup**: Removed unused utilities and `.impl` stubs
- ✅ **Cross-Domain Implementation (partial)**: Applied patterns in marketplace and core domains

**Detailed Implementation Plan**:

#### ✅ Week 1: Define Bounded Context Boundaries - COMPLETE

- ✅ Context Boundary Analysis and strategy
- ✅ Mapping patterns and ACL specifications
- ✅ Contract interfaces and integration points

#### ✅ Week 2: Implement Context Mapping - COMPLETE

- ✅ Outbound context mappers created with directional naming
- ✅ ACLs implemented (Clerk, RevenueCat)
- ✅ Documentation updated (guides + status)

#### ✅ Week 3: Integrate Domain Contracts in Apps — COMPLETE

- ✅ Integrate outbound context mappers in Marketplace User Management
  - `UserService`: uses `MarketplaceToLocationContextMapper`, `MarketplaceToCommunicationContextMapper`, `MarketplaceToInfrastructureContextMapper`
  - Tests updated and passing
- ✅ Integrate ACLs where applicable in Marketplace services
  - `AuthService`: `ClerkAntiCorruptionLayer`
  - `SubscriptionService`: `RevenueCatAntiCorruptionLayer`
  - Tests updated and passing
- ✅ Update modules to export renamed mappers per domain
- ✅ Documentation added: `ddd-context-mapping-refactor-summary.md`
- ✅ Integrate mappers/ACLs in remaining services
  - ✅ Vendor Management: Added location mapper for vendor location updates
  - ✅ Search Discovery: Using AlgoliaService ACL with proper patterns
  - ✅ Location Services: Added proper mapper usage for location data
  - ✅ Communication Services: Contracts ready, services pending implementation
  - ✅ Infrastructure Services: Contracts ready, services pending implementation
- ⏭️ Add service-level integration tests across domains (deferred to post-Phase 5)

#### ⏭️ Week 4: Testing & Validation — NEXT

- Expand integration tests for cross-context flows
- Contract-level metrics and monitoring (where appropriate)
- Validate performance and error handling

#### Week 5: Documentation & Training

- Implementation guides, best practices, and developer training

#### Week 6: Migration & Cleanup

- Migrate remaining services to new patterns and remove legacy code

**Success Metrics**:

**Technical Metrics**:

- **Contract Coverage**: All inter-domain communication via domain contracts

- **Test Coverage**: >90% for contracts and mappings
- **Performance**: <5ms overhead for translation
- **Error Rate**: <1% context-related errors in production

**Business Metrics**:
