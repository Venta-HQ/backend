### **🏗️ Current Architecture State**

**Implemented Services:**

- `apps/marketplace/user-management/` - User management operations (Clerk, RevenueCat, Vendor relationships)
  - `authentication/` - Clerk authentication handling
  - `subscriptions/` - RevenueCat subscription management
  - `vendors/` - User-vendor relationship management
- `apps/marketplace/vendor-management/` - Vendor management operations
- `apps/marketplace/search-discovery/` - Algolia search and discovery
- `apps/location-services/geolocation/` - Location tracking and geospatial queries
  - **NEW**: `LocationTrackingService` with domain logic and business rules
  - **NEW**: Domain-specific error handling and validation
  - **NEW**: Enhanced gRPC endpoints for domain operations
- `apps/location-services/real-time/` - WebSocket real-time location updates
- `apps/infrastructure/api-gateway/` - API Gateway with routing
- `apps/infrastructure/file-management/` - File upload and storage
- `apps/communication/webhooks/` - Webhook handlers (Clerk, RevenueCat)
  - `clerk/` - Clerk webhook processing
  - `revenuecat/` - RevenueCat webhook processing

```

### **🎯 Consistent Patterns Established**

**gRPC Pattern:**

- **Subdomain modules** define their own gRPC connections
- **Root modules** only handle app-level infrastructure (BootstrapModule, ConfigModule)
- **Controllers** use dependencies from their own modules
- **No dependency inversion** where subdomains depend on root-level infrastructure

**Domain Service Pattern:**

- **Domain validation** with business rules and constraints
- **Rich error handling** with domain context and details
- **Business logic** co-located with domain operations
- **Event emission** with domain-specific events and context
- **Entity validation** before performing operations

**Error Handling Pattern:**

- **Domain-specific error classes** with context information
- **Business rule validation** with meaningful error messages
- **Rich error details** for debugging and monitoring
- **Consistent error codes** across all domains

### **📊 Progress Summary**

- **Phase 1: Domain Organization** - ✅ **100% Complete**
- **Phase 2: Domain Services** - ✅ **100% Complete**
- **Phase 3: Domain Events** - 🔄 **Ready to Begin**
- **Phase 4: Bounded Contexts** - ⏳ **Pending**
- **Phase 5: Documentation & Training** - ⏳ **Pending**

### **🎯 Next Steps: Phase 3 - Domain Events**

**Ready to implement:**

1. **Create domain event schemas** for all domains
2. **Enhance event service** with domain context
3. **Update existing event emissions** to use domain events
4. **Add domain event validation** and business context

### **📋 Business Context**

**Core Domains:**

- **Marketplace**: User management, vendor management, search/discovery
- **Location Services**: Geolocation, real-time tracking (ENHANCED)
- **Infrastructure**: API Gateway, file management
- **Communication**: Webhook processing

**Key Features:**

- User registration and authentication (Clerk)
- Subscription management (RevenueCat)
- Vendor registration and management
- User-vendor relationships
- Real-time location tracking (ENHANCED with domain logic)
- Search and discovery via Algolia
- File upload and storage
- Webhook processing for external integrations

**Domain Enhancements:**

- **Location Services**: Enhanced with business validation, proximity alerts, and domain-specific error handling
- **Error Handling**: Rich domain context with business rules and validation
- **Service Architecture**: Domain-focused services with clear business boundaries

### **⚠️ Risks & Considerations**

- **Service Dependencies**: Ensure proper service communication patterns
- **Data Consistency**: Maintain data integrity across domains
- **Performance**: Monitor service performance after domain enhancements
- **Testing**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all domain functionality
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing API contracts while adding domain features
