### **🏗️ Current Architecture State**

**Implemented Services:**

- `apps/marketplace/vendor-management/` - Vendor management operations
- `apps/marketplace/search-discovery/` - Algolia search and discovery
- `apps/location-services/geolocation/` - Location tracking and geospatial queries
- `apps/location-services/real-time/` - WebSocket real-time location updates
- `apps/infrastructure/api-gateway/` - API Gateway with routing
- `apps/infrastructure/file-management/` - File upload and storage
- `apps/communication/webhooks/` - Webhook handlers (Clerk, RevenueCat)

**Domain Structure:**

### **📊 Progress Summary**

- **Phase 1: Domain Organization** - ✅ **100% Complete**
- **Phase 2: Domain Services** - 🔄 **Ready to Begin**
- **Phase 3: Domain Events** - ⏳ **Pending**
- **Phase 4: Bounded Contexts** - ⏳ **Pending**
- **Phase 5: Documentation & Training** - ⏳ **Pending**

### **🎯 Next Steps: Phase 2 - Domain Services**

**Ready to implement:**

1. **Create domain-specific error classes**
2. **Enhance existing services with domain logic**
3. **Add business validation rules**
4. **Update service interfaces**

### **📋 Business Context**

**Core Domains:**

- **Marketplace**: Vendor management, search/discovery
- **Location Services**: Geolocation, real-time tracking
- **Infrastructure**: API Gateway, file management
- **Communication**: Webhook processing

**Key Features:**

- Vendor registration and management
- Real-time location tracking
- Search and discovery via Algolia
- File upload and storage
- Webhook processing for external integrations

### **⚠️ Risks & Considerations**

- **Service Dependencies**: Ensure proper service communication patterns
- **Data Consistency**: Maintain data integrity across domains
- **Performance**: Monitor service performance after reorganization
- **Testing**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all domains

### **📈 Success Metrics**

- ✅ All services successfully moved to domain structure
- ✅ All tests passing (547/547)
- ✅ All builds successful
- ✅ Consistent patterns across all services
- ✅ Proper app naming and configuration
- ✅ Clean, maintainable codebase structure

### **🚀 Ready for Phase 2**

The foundation is solid and we're ready to begin **Phase 2: Domain Services** which will involve:

1. **Create domain-specific error classes**
2. **Enhance existing services with domain logic**
3. **Add business validation rules**
4. **Update service interfaces**
