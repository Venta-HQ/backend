### **✅ Completed**

- [x] Created initial domain directory structure
- [x] Moved `vendor` service to `apps/marketplace/vendor-management/`
- [x] Moved `location` service to `apps/location-services/geolocation/`
- [x] Moved `gateway` service to `apps/infrastructure/api-gateway/`
- [x] Moved `websocket-gateway` service to `apps/location-services/real-time/`
- [x] Moved `algolia-sync` service to `apps/marketplace/search-discovery/`
- [x] Created `apps/communication/webhooks/` for webhook services
- [x] Created `apps/infrastructure/file-management/` for file upload services
- [x] **RESTORED** `user` service to `apps/marketplace/user-management/` with full functionality
- [x] Updated `nest-cli.json` with new service paths and names
- [x] Updated all `tsconfig.app.json` files for moved services
- [x] Fixed import paths in all test files
- [x] Standardized file-management service patterns (Dockerfile, README, BootstrapModule)
- [x] Removed empty/unimplemented directories
- [x] Updated APP_NAMES configuration with unique app names
- [x] Updated webhook services to use BootstrapModule pattern
- [x] **ESTABLISHED CONSISTENT gRPC PATTERN** across all services
- [x] **FIXED WEBHOOKS SERVICE STRUCTURE** - moved gRPC setup to subdomain modules
- [x] **RENAMED SUBSCRIPTION TO REVENUECAT** for clarity and specificity
- [x] **ORGANIZED USER-MANAGEMENT** into subdomain modules (authentication, subscriptions, vendors)
- [x] All services follow consistent patterns and structure
- [x] All tests passing (579/579) - increased from 547 tests
- [x] All builds successful

### **🏗️ Current Architecture State**

**Implemented Services:**

- `apps/marketplace/user-management/` - User management operations (Clerk, RevenueCat, Vendor relationships)
  - `authentication/` - Clerk authentication handling
  - `subscriptions/` - RevenueCat subscription management
  - `vendors/` - User-vendor relationship management
- `apps/marketplace/vendor-management/` - Vendor management operations
- `apps/marketplace/search-discovery/` - Algolia search and discovery
- `apps/location-services/geolocation/` - Location tracking and geospatial queries
- `apps/location-services/real-time/` - WebSocket real-time location updates
- `apps/infrastructure/api-gateway/` - API Gateway with routing
- `apps/infrastructure/file-management/` - File upload and storage
- `apps/communication/webhooks/` - Webhook handlers (Clerk, RevenueCat)
  - `clerk/` - Clerk webhook processing
  - `revenuecat/` - RevenueCat webhook processing

```

### **🎯 Consistent Patterns Established**

**gRPC Pattern:**

- **Subdomain modules** define their own gRPC connections
- **Root modules** only handle app-level infrastructure (BootstrapModule, ConfigModule)
- **Controllers** use dependencies from their own modules
- **No dependency inversion** where subdomains depend on root-level infrastructure

**Module Organization:**

- **API Gateway submodules**: Define their own gRPC connections
- **User Management submodules**: Define their own domain dependencies (PrismaModule)
- **Webhooks submodules**: Define their own gRPC connections
- **Single-module services**: Define gRPC connections at root level

### **📊 Progress Summary**

- **Phase 1: Domain Organization** - ✅ **100% Complete**
- **Phase 2: Domain Services** - 🔄 **Ready to Begin**
- **Phase 3: Domain Events** - ⏳ **Pending**
- **Phase 4: Bounded Contexts** - ⏳ **Pending**
- **Phase 5: Documentation & Training** - ⏳ **Pending**

### **🎯 Next Steps: Phase 2 - Domain Services**

**Ready to implement:**

1. **Create domain-specific error classes**
2. **Enhance existing services with domain logic**
3. **Add business validation rules**
4. **Update service interfaces**

### **📋 Business Context**

**Core Domains:**

- **Marketplace**: User management, vendor management, search/discovery
- **Location Services**: Geolocation, real-time tracking
- **Infrastructure**: API Gateway, file management
- **Communication**: Webhook processing

**Key Features:**

- User registration and authentication (Clerk)
- Subscription management (RevenueCat)
- Vendor registration and management
- User-vendor relationships
- Real-time location tracking
- Search and discovery via Algolia
- File upload and storage
- Webhook processing for external integrations

### **⚠️ Risks & Considerations**

- **Service Dependencies**: Ensure proper service communication patterns
- **Data Consistency**: Maintain data integrity across domains
- **Performance**: Monitor service performance after reorganization
- **Testing**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all domains
