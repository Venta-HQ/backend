# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Migration Status

This document tracks the progress of our DDD migration across all phases.

## Migration Overview

We are transitioning from a technical-focused architecture to a domain-driven design that aligns with business capabilities and improves team scalability.

## Phase Status

### âœ… Phase 1: Domain Separation - COMPLETE

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE  
**Date**: Completed in previous iterations  
**Scope**: Initial domain separation and service boundaries

**Completed Tasks**:

- âœ… Separated services by business domains (marketplace, location-services, communication, infrastructure)
- âœ… Established clear domain boundaries
- âœ… Created domain-specific modules and services
- âœ… Implemented basic domain separation patterns

### âœ… Phase 2: Event Schema Standardization - COMPLETE

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE  
**Date**: Completed in previous iterations  
**Scope**: Standardized event schemas and validation

**Completed Tasks**:

- âœ… Implemented Zod-based event schemas
- âœ… Created centralized `eventtypes` library
- âœ… Standardized event validation patterns
- âœ… Established type-safe event emission
- âœ… Implemented unified event registry

### âœ… Phase 3: Domain Events with Rich Context - COMPLETE

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE  
**Date**: December 2024  
**Scope**: Transition to domain events with automatic business context

**Completed Tasks**:

- âœ… **DDD Event Naming**: Migrated all events to domain-based naming (`marketplace.vendor_onboarded`, `location.vendor_location_updated`)
- âœ… **Automatic Context Extraction**: Enhanced `EventService` to automatically extract business identifiers from Zod schemas
- âœ… **Type-Based Validation**: Implemented compile-time validation for event patterns using TypeScript template literal types
- âœ… **Schema-Driven Business Context**: Events now automatically include relevant business identifiers (vendorId, userId, etc.)
- âœ… **Simplified API**: Maintained existing `eventService.emit()` pattern while adding automatic context
- âœ… **Event Structure Refactoring**: Updated `BaseEvent` to use `context`, `meta`, and `data` structure
- âœ… **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Removed theoretical/unused domains and schemas
- âœ… **Logging Standardization**: Fixed and standardized all logging patterns across the codebase

**Key Improvements**:

- **Event Naming**: `vendor.onboarded` â†’ `marketplace.vendor_onboarded`
- **Automatic Context**: No more manual business context extraction
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time validation of event patterns
- **Cleaner Schemas**: Removed unused fields, added missing ones
- **Structured Logging**: All logs now include proper structured data and stack traces

## Migration Summary

### âœ… All Phases Complete

The DDD migration is now **100% complete**. We have successfully:

1. **Separated domains** with clear boundaries
2. **Standardized event schemas** with type safety
3. **Implemented domain events** with rich business context
4. **Enhanced observability** with structured logging

### ðŸŽ¯ Benefits Achieved

- **Business Alignment**: Events and services now reflect business capabilities
- **Team Scalability**: Clear domain boundaries enable parallel development
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time validation prevents runtime errors
- **Observability**: Rich context and structured logging improve debugging
- **Maintainability**: Clean, consistent patterns across the codebase

### ðŸ“Š Technical Metrics

- **Event Schemas**: 8 domain events with automatic context
- **Services**: 4 domain-aligned microservices
- **Logging**: 100% standardized with structured data
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time validation for all event patterns

## Next Steps

With the DDD migration complete, the focus can now shift to:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor and optimize event processing
2. **Feature Development**: Leverage the new domain structure for new features
3. **Monitoring Enhancement**: Build domain-specific dashboards and alerts
4. **Team Training**: Document patterns for new team members
