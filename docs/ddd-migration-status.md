# üèóÔ∏è DDD Migration Status

## üìä Current Status: **Phase 2 Complete - Ready for Phase 3**

### ‚úÖ Completed Phases

#### **Phase 1: Domain Organization** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- **Domain-based application structure** implemented
- **Subdomain modules** organized by business domains
- **Consistent naming patterns** established
- **Clear separation** between domain logic and infrastructure
- **Bootstrap pattern** applied across all applications

**Key Achievements:**

- Organized `user-management` into subdomains: `authentication`, `subscriptions`, `vendors`, `core`, `location`
- Organized `vendor-management` into subdomains: `core`, `location`
- Organized `webhooks` into provider-specific modules: `clerk`, `revenuecat`
- Established consistent module patterns and naming conventions
- Maintained backward compatibility throughout reorganization

#### **Phase 2: Domain Services** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- **Enhanced existing services** with domain context and business logic
- **Unified error handling system** with automatic domain context
- **New `eventtypes` library** for centralized event management
- **Improved separation of concerns** between domain logic and infrastructure
- **Enhanced logging** with business context and domain semantics
- **Removed redundant validation** (already handled by gRPC contracts and event system)
- **Consolidated error codes** into single source of truth

**Key Achievements:**

- Enhanced `UserService` with domain methods: `registerUser`, `updateUserLocation`
- Enhanced `VendorService` with domain methods: `onboardVendor`, `updateVendorLocation`
- Enhanced `SubscriptionService` with domain methods: `activateSubscription`
- Enhanced `AuthService` with domain methods: `handleUserCreated`, `handleUserDeleted`
- Enhanced `AlgoliaSyncService` with focused business logic (removed redundant validation)
- Enhanced `UserVendorService` with domain methods: `getUserVendors`, `validateVendorOwnership`
- Enhanced `LocationService` and `LocationTrackingService` with domain-specific error handling
- **Created `eventtypes` library** for centralized event definitions and schemas
- **Consolidated error handling** - removed domain-specific error classes, unified to `AppError`
- **Automatic domain context** via `AppExceptionFilter` for all errors
- **Explicit DDD domain configuration** in all application bootstrap options
- **Updated domain folder structure** across all libraries to align with DDD domains
- Added proper business context to all logging and error messages
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy methods

### üöß Current Phase: **Phase 3: Domain Events**

#### **Phase 3: Domain Events** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- **Transform event names** from technical to domain-driven naming
- **Enhance event schemas** with rich business context and smart defaults
- **Maintain existing patterns** - keep `eventService.emit()` approach unchanged
- **Update event handlers** to listen for new DDD event names

**Completed Work:**

- ‚úÖ **Updated vendor event schemas** with DDD names (`marketplace.vendor_onboarded`, `marketplace.vendor_profile_updated`, `location.vendor_location_updated`)
- ‚úÖ **Updated user event schemas** with DDD names (`marketplace.user_registered`, `marketplace.user_profile_updated`, `location.user_location_updated`)
- ‚úÖ **Updated vendor service** to emit DDD events while keeping existing `eventService.emit()` pattern
- ‚úÖ **Updated location service** to emit DDD events while keeping existing `eventService.emit()` pattern
- ‚úÖ **Updated event handlers** to listen for new DDD event names (Algolia sync, user location handlers)
- ‚úÖ **Updated unified event registry** with new DDD event schemas
- ‚úÖ **Added smart defaults** to event schemas (timestamps, business logic defaults)
- ‚úÖ **Removed backward compatibility** - clean DDD-only implementation
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced EventService** with automatic domain context extraction
- ‚úÖ **Updated base event types** with domain context fields

**Key Achievements:**

- **DDD Event Naming**: Transformed from `vendor.created` to `marketplace.vendor_onboarded`
- **Rich Business Context**: Events now contain business meaning, not just technical data
- **Smart Defaults**: Automatic timestamps and business logic (business hours, movement type)
- **Automatic Domain Context**: Domain/subdomain extracted from event names
- **Clean Implementation**: No legacy events - pure DDD approach
- **Enhanced Logging**: Rich context in all event logs with domain information
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support maintained throughout
- **Existing Patterns**: Kept `eventService.emit()` approach exactly as preferred

### üìã Remaining Phases

#### **Phase 4: Bounded Contexts** ‚è≥ PENDING

- **Define clear bounded contexts** for each domain
- **Implement context mapping** between domains
- **Establish domain boundaries** and interfaces
- **Optimize for team ownership** and scalability

#### **Phase 5: Advanced DDD Patterns** ‚è≥ PENDING

- **Implement aggregates** for complex business entities
- **Add domain repositories** for data access patterns
- **Implement value objects** for business concepts
- **Add domain specifications** for complex queries

## üéØ Migration Goals
