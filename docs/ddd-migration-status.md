# DDD Migration Status

## Current Status: Phase 2 In Progress

### Phase 1: Domain Organization ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- [x] Organized code into domain-specific directories
- [x] Created bounded context boundaries
- [x] Established domain-specific schemas and types
- [x] Implemented domain-specific validation rules

### Phase 2: Domain Services üîÑ IN PROGRESS

- [x] Created domain-specific error classes with rich context
- [x] Enhanced LocationTrackingService with business validation rules
- [x] Added domain validation for coordinates and entity existence
- [x] Updated location controller with new domain methods
- [x] Added comprehensive tests for domain functionality
- [ ] **MAJOR ISSUES TO FIX:**
  - [ ] Type errors in unified event registry
  - [ ] Missing type exports causing compilation failures
  - [ ] Integration issues with existing event system
  - [ ] Need to review and fix domain service implementation
  - [ ] Ensure all existing functionality still works correctly

### Phase 3: Domain Events ‚è≥ PENDING

- [ ] Create domain event schemas for all domains
- [ ] Enhance event service with domain context
- [ ] Update existing event emissions to use domain events
- [ ] Add domain event validation and business context

### Phase 4: Bounded Contexts ‚è≥ PENDING

- [ ] Implement bounded context boundaries
- [ ] Create context mapping
- [ ] Establish inter-context communication patterns
- [ ] Implement anti-corruption layers

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Phase 2 Issues**: Address the major type errors and integration problems
2. **Complete Phase 2**: Ensure all domain services work correctly with existing system
3. **Begin Phase 3**: Start implementing domain events once Phase 2 is stable

## Notes

- Phase 2 has significant issues that need to be resolved before moving forward
- The domain service implementation needs review and refinement
- Integration with existing event system requires attention
