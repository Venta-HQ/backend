### **Migration Summary**

```
✅ All services successfully moved to domain structure
✅ All configuration files updated
✅ All import paths fixed
✅ All tests passing (547/547)
✅ All builds successful
✅ All services follow consistent patterns
✅ File-management service cleanup completed
```

### **Immediate (This Week)**

1. **✅ Service Structure Cleanup** - COMPLETED

   - ✅ Fixed file-management service directory structure
   - ✅ Added missing Dockerfile and README.md
   - ✅ Updated module to use BootstrapModule pattern
   - ✅ Added FILE_MANAGEMENT to APP_NAMES
   - ✅ Verified all services follow consistent patterns

2. **✅ Configuration Updates** - COMPLETED
   - ✅ Updated `nest-cli.json` with new service paths
   - ✅ Updated `tsconfig.app.json` files with correct relative paths
   - ✅ Fixed all import paths in test files

### **Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)**

1. **Phase 2: Domain Services**
   - Create domain-specific error classes
   - Enhance existing services with business logic
   - Add business validation rules
   - Update service interfaces

### **Medium Term (Next Month)**

1. **Phase 4: Bounded Contexts**
   - Define clear domain boundaries
   - Create domain-specific modules
   - Update service communication
   - Integration testing

### **Implemented Features**

Based on API analysis, here's what's currently working:

#### **🔍 User Management**

- ✅ Clerk-based authentication
- ✅ Basic user profiles
- ✅ User-vendor relationships

#### **🏪 Vendor Management**

- ✅ Create, read, update vendor profiles
- ✅ Vendor ownership by users
- ✅ Profile data management

#### **📍 Location Services**

- ✅ Real-time location tracking (users & vendors)
- ✅ Geospatial queries (find nearby vendors)
- ✅ Location history and updates

#### **🔍 Search & Discovery**

- ✅ Algolia integration
- ✅ Location-based search
- ✅ Basic vendor search

#### **📤 File Management**

- ✅ Image upload functionality
- ✅ Cloud file storage

#### **🔗 External Integrations**

- ✅ Clerk webhooks
- ✅ Subscription webhooks
- ✅ RevenueCat integration

### **Core Business Model**

- **Primary Users**: Mobile food vendors and consumers
- **Core Value**: Real-time vendor visibility and discovery
- **Key Features**: Location tracking, vendor profiles, search/discovery

### **Current Business Processes**

1. **Vendor Onboarding**: Create profile, set location, go live
2. **User Discovery**: View map, search vendors, get real-time updates
3. **Location Management**: Real-time location tracking and broadcasting

### **Future Business Features** (Design Considerations)

- Reviews & ratings system
- User favorites/bookmarking
- Order management and tracking
- Payment processing
- Analytics and insights

### **Technical Risks**

- **Import Path Updates**: ✅ RESOLVED - All paths updated and working
- **Configuration Updates**: ✅ RESOLVED - All configs updated
- **Build Failures**: ✅ RESOLVED - All builds successful

### **Business Risks**

- **Team Learning Curve**: DDD concepts may require team training
- **Complexity Increase**: Initial complexity increase before benefits are realized

### **Mitigation Strategies**

- **Incremental Migration**: ✅ COMPLETED - Phase 1 done successfully
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing APIs during migration
- **Comprehensive Testing**: ✅ COMPLETED - All tests passing
- **Documentation**: ✅ COMPLETED - All services documented

### **Technical Metrics**

- ✅ All services successfully moved to domain structure
