# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Migration Status

This document tracks the progress of our DDD migration across all phases.

## Migration Overview

We are transitioning from a technical-focused architecture to a domain-driven design that aligns with business capabilities and improves team scalability.

## Phase Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Domain Separation - COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ Established clear domain boundaries
- ✅ Created domain-specific modules and services
- ✅ Implemented basic domain separation patterns

### ✅ Phase 2: Event Schema Standardization - COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date**: Completed in previous iterations  
**Scope**: Standardized event schemas and validation

**Completed Tasks**:

- ✅ Implemented Zod-based event schemas

- ✅ Implemented unified event registry

### ✅ Phase 3: Domain Events with Rich Context - COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date**: December 2024  
**Scope**: Transition to domain events with automatic business context

**Completed Tasks**:

- ✅ **DDD Event Naming**: Migrated all events to domain-based naming (`marketplace.vendor.onboarded`, `location.vendor.location_updated`)
- ✅ **Automatic Context Extraction**: Enhanced `EventService` to automatically extract business identifiers from Zod schemas
- ✅ **Type-Based Validation**: Implemented compile-time validation for event patterns using TypeScript template literal types
- ✅ **Schema-Driven Business Context**: Events now automatically include relevant business identifiers (vendorId, userId, etc.)
- ✅ **Simplified API**: Maintained existing `eventService.emit()` pattern while adding automatic context
- ✅ **Event Structure Refactoring**: Updated `BaseEvent` to use `context`, `meta`, and `data` structure
- ✅ **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Removed theoretical/unused domains and schemas
