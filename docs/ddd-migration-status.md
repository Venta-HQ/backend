   - Add domain validation rules

2. **Phase 3: Domain Events**
   - Create domain event schemas
   - Implement business-focused events
   - Update existing event emissions

### **Medium Term (Next Month)**
1. **Phase 4: Bounded Contexts**
   - Define clear domain boundaries
   - Create domain-specific modules
   - Update service communication

2. **Documentation & Training**
   - Update all documentation
   - Create domain-specific guides
   - Team training on DDD concepts

## 🚨 Known Issues & Risks

### **Technical Risks**
- **Import Path Updates**: Need to systematically update all import paths after service moves
- **Configuration Updates**: `nest-cli.json` and `tsconfig.app.json` files need updates
- **Build Failures**: Potential build issues during migration

### **Business Risks**
- **Feature Development Pause**: Migration may temporarily slow feature development
- **Team Learning Curve**: DDD concepts may require team training
- **Complexity Increase**: Initial complexity increase before benefits are realized

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Incremental Migration**: Move one service at a time, test thoroughly
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing APIs during migration
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test each migration step before proceeding
- **Documentation**: Keep detailed migration logs
