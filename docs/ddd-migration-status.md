# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Migration Status

This document tracks the progress of our DDD migration across all phases.

## Migration Overview

We are transitioning from a technical-focused architecture to a domain-driven design that aligns with business capabilities and improves team scalability.

## Phase Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Domain Separation - COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date**: Completed in previous iterations  
**Scope**: Initial domain separation and service boundaries

**Completed Tasks**:

- ✅ Separated services by business domains (marketplace, location-services, communication, infrastructure)
- ✅ Established clear domain boundaries
- ✅ Created domain-specific modules and services
- ✅ Implemented basic domain separation patterns

### ✅ Phase 2: Event Schema Standardization - COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date**: Completed in previous iterations  
**Scope**: Standardized event schemas and validation

**Completed Tasks**:

- ✅ Implemented Zod-based event schemas
- ✅ Created centralized `eventtypes` library
- ✅ Standardized event validation patterns
- ✅ Established type-safe event emission
- ✅ Implemented unified event registry

### ✅ Phase 3: Domain Events with Rich Context - COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date**: December 2024  
**Scope**: Transition to domain events with automatic business context

**Completed Tasks**:

- ✅ **DDD Event Naming**: Migrated all events to domain-based naming (`marketplace.vendor_onboarded`, `location.vendor_location_updated`)
- ✅ **Automatic Context Extraction**: Enhanced `EventService` to automatically extract business identifiers from Zod schemas
- ✅ **Type-Based Validation**: Implemented compile-time validation for event patterns using TypeScript template literal types
- ✅ **Schema-Driven Business Context**: Events now automatically include relevant business identifiers (vendorId, userId, etc.)
- ✅ **Simplified API**: Maintained existing `eventService.emit()` pattern while adding automatic context
- ✅ **Event Structure Refactoring**: Updated `BaseEvent` to use `context`, `meta`, and `data` structure
- ✅ **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Removed theoretical/unused domains and schemas
- ✅ **Logging Standardization**: Fixed and standardized all logging patterns across the codebase

**Key Improvements**:

- **Event Naming**: `vendor.onboarded` → `marketplace.vendor_onboarded`
- **Automatic Context**: No more manual business context extraction
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time validation of event patterns
- **Cleaner Schemas**: Removed unused fields, added missing ones
- **Structured Logging**: All logs now include proper structured data and stack traces

### ⏳ Phase 4: Bounded Contexts - PENDING

**Status**: ⏳ PENDING  
**Date**: Not yet started  
**Scope**: Define clear bounded contexts and context mapping

**Planned Tasks**:

- 🔲 **Define Bounded Contexts**: Establish clear boundaries for each domain
- 🔲 **Context Mapping**: Implement mapping between different bounded contexts
- 🔲 **Domain Boundaries**: Establish explicit interfaces between domains
- 🔲 **Team Ownership**: Optimize domain structure for team scalability
- 🔲 **Integration Testing**: Validate context boundaries and interfaces
- 🔲 **Documentation**: Update team documentation and training materials

**Implementation Strategy**:

- **Week 1**: Define bounded context boundaries for each domain
- **Week 2**: Implement context mapping between domains
- **Week 3**: Establish domain boundaries and interfaces
- **Week 4**: Optimize for team ownership and scalability
- **Week 5**: Integration testing and validation
- **Week 6**: Documentation updates and team training

### ⏳ Phase 5: Advanced DDD Patterns - PENDING

**Status**: ⏳ PENDING  
**Date**: Not yet started  
**Scope**: Implement advanced DDD patterns for complex business logic

**Planned Tasks**:

- 🔲 **Aggregates**: Implement aggregate patterns for complex business entities
- 🔲 **Domain Repositories**: Add repository patterns for data access
- 🔲 **Value Objects**: Implement value objects for business concepts
- 🔲 **Domain Specifications**: Add specification patterns for complex queries
- 🔲 **Domain Services**: Enhance domain services with advanced patterns
- 🔲 **Event Sourcing**: Consider event sourcing for audit trails and business history

**Implementation Strategy**:

- **Week 1**: Identify candidates for aggregates and value objects
- **Week 2**: Implement aggregate patterns for vendor and user entities
- **Week 3**: Add domain repositories for data access patterns
- **Week 4**: Implement value objects for business concepts (location, contact info)
- **Week 5**: Add domain specifications for complex business queries
- **Week 6**: Integration testing and performance validation

## Migration Summary

### ✅ Completed Phases: 3/5

The DDD migration has completed the foundational phases and is ready for advanced patterns:

1. ✅ **Domain Separation** - Clear domain boundaries established
2. ✅ **Event Schema Standardization** - Type-safe event management
3. ✅ **Domain Events with Rich Context** - Business-aligned event patterns
4. ⏳ **Bounded Contexts** - Context mapping and team optimization
5. ⏳ **Advanced DDD Patterns** - Complex business logic patterns

### 🎯 Benefits Achieved

- **Business Alignment**: Events and services now reflect business capabilities
- **Team Scalability**: Clear domain boundaries enable parallel development
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time validation prevents runtime errors
- **Observability**: Rich context and structured logging improve debugging
- **Maintainability**: Clean, consistent patterns across the codebase

### 📊 Technical Metrics

- **Event Schemas**: 8 domain events with automatic context
- **Services**: 4 domain-aligned microservices
- **Logging**: 100% standardized with structured data
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time validation for all event patterns

## Next Steps

With the foundational phases complete, the focus can now shift to:

1. **Phase 4 Implementation**: Begin bounded context definition and context mapping
2. **Team Planning**: Assess team structure and ownership for Phase 4
3. **Advanced Patterns**: Evaluate need for Phase 5 patterns based on business complexity
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor current patterns and optimize as needed
