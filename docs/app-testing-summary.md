# Venta Backend: App Testing and Individual Running Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the testing strategy and individual app running capabilities for the Venta backend monorepo.

## What's Been Set Up

### 1. Updated Docker Compose Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` has been enhanced to include all necessary services:

- **PostgreSQL** (port 5432) - Main database
- **Redis** (port 6379) - Caching and session storage
- **NATS** (ports 4222, 8222) - Message broker for inter-service communication
- **Loki** (port 3100) - Log aggregation
- **Grafana** (port 3001) - Monitoring dashboard

All services include health checks and proper networking.

### 2. Comprehensive Testing Strategy

Created `docs/testing-strategy.md` with detailed testing requirements for each app:

#### Testing Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Individual functions and classes
- **Integration Tests**: Service interactions and external dependencies
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflows
- **Load Tests**: Performance under stress

#### App-Specific Testing Requirements

| App | Primary Tests | Key Dependencies |
|-----|---------------|------------------|
| Gateway | Auth, Rate limiting, File uploads | Clerk, Cloudinary, gRPC services |
| User | User management, Subscriptions | Clerk, Database, NATS |
| Vendor | CRUD operations, Search | Database, Algolia, NATS |
| Location | Geospatial, Real-time updates | Redis, Database, NATS |
| WebSocket | Connection management, Broadcasting | Redis, NATS, Location service |
| Algolia Sync | Data synchronization | Algolia, NATS |

### 3. Sample Test Files

Created example test files demonstrating best practices:

- `apps/gateway/src/user/user.controller.spec.ts` - E2E test example
- `apps/user/src/clerk/clerk.service.spec.ts` - Integration test example
- `test/load/gateway-load-test.js` - Load testing example

### 4. App Running with NestJS CLI

Each app can be run individually using standard NestJS CLI commands:

```bash
# Development mode
nest start gateway --watch
nest start user --watch
# etc.

# Production mode
nest build gateway
nest build user
# etc.

# Testing
nest test gateway
nest test user
# etc.
```

### 5. Enhanced Package.json Scripts

Added infrastructure and load testing scripts:

```bash
# Infrastructure
npm run docker:up      # Start all services
npm run docker:down    # Stop all services
npm run docker:logs    # View logs

# Load testing
npm run load:gateway   # Load test gateway
```

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Start Infrastructure
```bash
npm run docker:up
```

### 2. Run Individual Apps
```bash
# Start the app you want to work on
nest start gateway --watch

# In another terminal, start dependencies if needed
nest start user --watch
nest start location --watch
```

### 3. Run Tests
```bash
# Test the app you're working on
nest test gateway

# Run all tests
npm run test:run
```

### 4. Load Testing
```bash
# Test performance
npm run load:gateway
```

## Testing Priorities

### High Priority (Start Here)
1. **Gateway Service** - Core API functionality
2. **User Service** - Authentication and user management
3. **Vendor Service** - Core business logic

### Medium Priority
4. **Location Service** - Real-time features
5. **WebSocket Gateway** - Real-time communication

### Lower Priority
6. **Algolia Sync Service** - Search optimization

## Testing Best Practices

### 1. Test Structure
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- Mock external dependencies
- Clean up test data

### 2. Coverage Goals
- Unit tests: 80%+ coverage
- Integration tests: Critical paths
- E2E tests: Key user workflows
- Load tests: Performance benchmarks

### 3. Test Data Management
- Use factories for test data
- Isolate test databases
- Clean up after tests

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Health Checks
- All services have health endpoints
- Docker Compose includes health checks
- Grafana dashboard for monitoring

### Logging
- Centralized logging with Loki
- Structured logging with Pino
- Request tracing and correlation

### Debugging
- Hot reload in development mode
- Detailed error messages
- Stack traces and context

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Start with Gateway tests** - Core functionality
2. **Set up CI/CD pipeline** - Automated testing
3. **Write integration tests** - Service interactions
4. **Implement load testing** - Performance validation

### Long-term Goals
1. **Contract testing** - Service interfaces
2. **Chaos engineering** - Resilience testing
3. **Security testing** - Vulnerability assessment
4. **Performance regression** - Continuous monitoring

## Resources

- [Testing Strategy](./testing-strategy.md) - Detailed testing requirements
- [Running Apps Guide](./running-apps.md) - Complete setup instructions
- [Docker Compose](./../docker-compose.yml) - Infrastructure configuration
- [Package.json](./../package.json) - Available scripts and commands

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the troubleshooting section in the running apps guide
2. Review service logs with `npm run docker:logs`
3. Verify infrastructure health with `docker-compose ps`
4. Run tests to identify specific problems

This setup provides a solid foundation for developing and testing the Venta backend applications individually while maintaining the ability to run them as a complete system.
